# 42 BARCELONA - C Piscine 2023

In Agust 2023 I joined 42 Barcelona. During this period of time I did an intensive "Bootcamp" where I could learnt the programming fundamentals, using C.

The 42 Barcelona Campus is open 24/7, so it means that everything is up to me. Without teachers, books, scheduls, the progress was based on my hard and soft skills.

These challenging 26 days I had to improve my self study, the information research but above all, the team work, because there were another +150 students like me, who were being tested to pass the C Piscine.

I made really good friends, everyone was trying to help each other and learning at the same time.

Before this 26 days I alredy knew programming in JavaScript, PHP...but after this period of time I know what is going on behind the default functions I used to implement in my code. I passed the C Piscine, so being able to learn many other technologies is quite exciting.

Honestly, I recommed everyone to try this "BootCamp". KEEP LEARNING!
