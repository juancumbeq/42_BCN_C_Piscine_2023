#42 BARCELONA - C Piscine 2023

In August 2023, I joined 42 Barcelona. During this period, I participated in an intensive "Bootcamp" where I had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming, specifically using C.

The 42 Barcelona Campus is open 24/7, which means that everything depended on me. Without teachers, textbooks, or schedules, my progress relied on my hard and soft skills.

During these challenging 26 days, I had to improve my self-study abilities, refine my information research skills, and, most importantly, enhance my teamwork skills because there were over 150 other students like me who were being tested to pass the C Piscine.

I made some great friends, and everyone was eager to help each other while learning simultaneously.

Before these 26 days, I already had experience in programming with JavaScript and PHP, but after this period, I gained a deeper understanding of what happens behind the scenes in the default functions I used to implement in my code. I successfully passed the C Piscine, which makes me excited about the prospect of learning many other technologies.

Honestly, I recommend that everyone should try this "Bootcamp." KEEP LEARNING!

See you at 42 BCN!
